# Pluto
Maybe an optimised fork of Pufferfish. Mileage may vary per setup.

## Support
I don't provide support for this fork. This is mostly just so I can use it as a base for my private forks. If you want to use it, just make sure you test before uploading to production.

## Building
No downloads, you have to build it yourself.

```bash
./gradlew applyPatches
./gradlew createReobfPaperclipJar
```
